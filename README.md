To use this code, run the GUI.py file using python.
A GUI will pop up and allow you to input the desired starting conditions for the pendulum simulations.

Open Matlab and run the n_pen.m code to see the simulation of the pendulum you created using the GUI.

The files in the current folder will generate an animation for a 20 link pendulum with the the following starting conditions:

Lengths all 1m
Masses all 1kg
Theta0 all pi/2
Tetha_v0 all 0

Run for 20 seconds
